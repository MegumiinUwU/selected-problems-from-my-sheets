Number scrabble is played with the list of numbers between 1 and 9. Each player takes turns picking a 
number from the list. Once a number has been picked, it cannot be picked again. If out of the number a 
player has picked so far, three numbers add up to 15, that player wins the game. However, if all the 
numbers are used and no player gets exactly 15, the game is a draw.
Example: (1) 4 (2) 7 (1) 3 (2) 8 (1) 5 (2) 6 (1) 1 (2) 2 => 2 wins ( 7 + 6 + 2 = 15)
