Write a python function that takes an integer number (size) then it generates Fibonacci 
sequence with the given size. (Hint: The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the 
next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence 
looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …)
For example: if we input 3 the output will be 1, 1, 2
If we input 6  the output will be 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
